Simple Screen Recorder Installation and Configuration
This is a Bash script to install Simple Screen Recorder on Debian-based systems, along with the required audio packages. The script updates the package list, installs pulseaudio, alsa-utils, and Simple Screen Recorder using the apt package manager, and configures the X server to allow local root access.

To use the script, simply copy the code into a Bash file and run it with root privileges. Once the installation is complete, you should be able to start Simple Screen Recorder and begin recording your screen and audio.

Note that the script also includes a command to configure the X server to allow local root access. While this can be useful for testing and development purposes, granting access to the X server in this way can be a security risk. Use this command with caution and only on trusted systems.

If you encounter any issues with Simple Screen Recorder or the audio packages, please refer to the official documentation and support channels for assistance.
